# simple-go-webserver

*This tool is a side product of me creating my own website.  
This is nothing sophisticated. [Read the story here.](https://quehl.xyz/0_about.html)*   

This is a simple https file server.
Does server static websites of the box.
Just put your stuff in the `./public` directory.

## Run

Customize the volume mount and the GOARCH in the docker-compose file and just start it :)

```bash
docker-compose up
```
