# simple-go-webserver

*this is just a private project, nothing sophisticated*

This is a simple https file server.
Does server static websites of the box.
Just put your stuff in the `./public` directory.

## Run

Customize the volume mount and the GOARCH in the docker-compose file and just start it :)

```bash
docker-compose up
```
